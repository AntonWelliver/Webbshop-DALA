Idea for Webshop: A webshop for food delivery to the door. The food can be divided into different categories such as "Fruit", "Drinks", "Cheese". Administrator can log in, change price, delete and add dishes. Customers should be able to browse and shop food in the webshop without being logged in, but also be able to log in, track their purchases and see their own purchase history. You should also be able to get recommendations according to what you bought earlier. It should also be possible to receive discounts if you register for newsletters.
